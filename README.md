## Background Unity

We always use Unity to develop front-end "games", but what about backend software/service?
This project is a simple proof of concept that Unity can be used to develop such software.

Since it's just proof of concept, all it will do is change a txt file without the user's knowledge! **The only way to know that the software is running is by opening the Task Manager.**

## Use case

This knowledge could be applied to develop an anti-cheating system entirely written in C# Unity or even a multiplayer server that does not appear on the windows taskbar.

## How to open

The build is inside this repo. But to open it in hidde mode, you must use the Bat file. 

just oppen **BUILD\abrir jogo.bat**

## Built With

Unity 2020.1.6f1
